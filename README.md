#  MGLogger

MGLogger is a ~trivial framework that can be used to log NSStrings to a display in MacOS and iOS apps. It allows searching for strings and filtering the content on those searched strings.

I've also included 2 apps - 1 MacOS, 1 iOS - that use the framework to demonstrate how it can be used.
